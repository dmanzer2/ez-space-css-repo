Bootstrap utility classes for quickly adding padding and margin spacing. Ideal for Bootstrap 3 media queries

### Conventions

This modular based css class system is to be used in conjunction with any html structure. Works well if you understand the bootstrap column naming convention. For instance, xs = extra small, s = small, m = medium, l = large. Built with Bootstrap's native media queries.

#### Media Queries:

xs = extra small

s = small

m = medium

l = large

#### Box Model:

p = padding

m = margin

t = top

l = left

b = bottom

r = right

#### Sizes in pixels using increments of 5:

5px - 100px sizing

### The basics

Apply these classes to your html to quickly add additional margin or padding space. Classes are as follows:

**Example: .xs-ml-10 = margin of 10px applied to the left of any element on a mobile device**

**Example: .sm-mr-20 = margin of 20px applied to the right of any element on a tablet device**

### install with npm
